## ÔøΩ Article Publishing System

### Content Management Overview
Manaboodle uses a simple, maintainable article system with centralized content management and automated deployment.

#### Article Publishing Process

**1. Content Structure**
- All articles are managed in `/src/lib/content.ts`
- Featured article appears on home page and gets priority in search results
- Categories: `concept`, `project`, `casestudy`, `random`
- Each article has: id, title, excerpt, category, publishedAt, readTime, featured, slug, author, content

**2. Adding New Articles**
```typescript
// Example article entry in content.ts
{
  id: 'article-slug',
  title: 'Article Title',
  excerpt: 'Brief description for cards and previews',
  category: 'concept', // concept | project | casestudy | random
  publishedAt: '2025-09-26',
  readTime: 2,
  featured: true, // Only one article should be featured at a time
  slug: 'article-slug',
  author: 'Author Name',
  content: `Full article content for search functionality...`
}
```

**3. Creating Article Pages**
- Create directory: `/src/app/[category]/[article-slug]/`
- Create page: `/src/app/[category]/[article-slug]/page.tsx`
- Use existing templates (e.g., `/concepts/ai-nurturing/page.tsx`) as reference
- Include proper metadata, navigation, images, and content structure

**4. Image Management**
- Add images to `/public/images/[image-name].jpg`
- Update category page mappings (e.g., `/concepts/page.tsx`) with image paths
- Images appear in: home featured card, category list page, article header

**5. URL Mapping & Navigation**
- Update category page URL mappings for custom routes
- Add article ID to home page `allowedArticleIds` array if it should appear on homepage
- Example: `'synthetic-intelligence-truth': '/concepts/synthetic-intelligence-truth'`

**6. Deployment**
- All changes auto-deploy via Vercel when pushed to main branch
- No build process needed - Next.js handles everything automatically
- Search functionality updates automatically with new content

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Avoiding Duplicates**
- **Use consistent naming**: Choose ONE slug format and stick to it
- **Check existing folders**: Before creating new article, verify no similar folders exist
- **Clean up immediately**: If duplicates are created, delete unused folders immediately
- **Follow the pattern**: Use descriptive, URL-friendly slugs (kebab-case)
- **Single source of truth**: The article ID in `content.ts` must match the folder name exactly

#### Recent Article Updates

**Repository Cleanup (September 26, 2025)**
- **Removed duplicate article folder**: Deleted `/concepts/synthetic-intelligence-truth/` 
- **Consolidated structure**: Using `/concepts/k-pop-demon-hunters-synthetic-truth/` as the single source
- **Updated README**: Added warnings and best practices to prevent future duplicates
- **Article formatting**: Fixed paragraph spacing and image caption placement

**Latest: "Helping Kids Nurture Synthetic Intelligence to Form 'Truth'" (September 26, 2025)**
- **New Featured Article**: Replaces childcare startup article as home page featured
- **Category**: Concept - exploring AI, children, education, and synthetic truth
- **Image**: Uses `/images/hi.jpg` across all three display contexts
- **Content Flow**: Home featured ‚Üí Concepts list ‚Üí Full article page
- **Previous Featured**: Moved childcare startup article to regular projects list
- **Formatting**: Added proper paragraph breaks and correct image caption text

**Previous: Childcare Startup Article (September 7, 2025)**
- **Status**: Moved from featured to regular project article
- **Author**: Jenna Winocur - first guest author on the platform
- **Impact**: Established guest author functionality and content diversity

### Category-Specific Pages

#### Concepts (`/concepts/`)
- Focuses on ideas, theories, and conceptual explorations
- Current articles: AI Nurturing, Synthetic Intelligence & Truth
- Template: Use `/concepts/ai-nurturing/page.tsx` for new concept articles

#### Projects (`/projects/`)
- Showcases actual work, tools, and implementations
- Includes: Tools, Childcare Startup Journey, Nanny project, KaraokeGoGo
- Template: Use existing project article structure

#### Case Studies (`/casestudies/`)
- In-depth analysis of real-world implementations
- Currently: Mangrove case study
- Template: Use `/casestudies/mangrove/page.tsx`

#### Random (`/random/`)
- Personal thoughts, quick ideas, experimental content
- Flexible format for various content types
