# URGENT SECURITY ACTION REQUIRED - October 7, 2025

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Secrets Still Exposed in Git History

Even though we removed the files, the secrets are **still in Git history** and visible to anyone with read access to the repository. GitHub Secret Scanning has detected these and they need to be rotated IMMEDIATELY.

---

## üî¥ STEP 1: Rotate All Secrets (DO THIS NOW)

### A. Rotate Supabase Service Role Key

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/otxidzozhdnszvqbgzne/settings/api
2. Under "Service Role Key" section
3. Click **"Generate New Service Role Key"** or **"Rotate Key"**
4. Copy the new key
5. Update in Vercel:
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/manabunagaokas-projects/manaboodle/settings/environment-variables
   - Find `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - Click Edit ‚Üí Paste new key ‚Üí Save
6. Redeploy: https://vercel.com/manabunagaokas-projects/manaboodle

### B. Rotate Resend API Key

1. Go to: https://resend.com/api-keys
2. Find key `re_Tt59K67n_2Hya8aQPSZbqvUXVsLCZKWbP`
3. Click **"Delete"** or **"Revoke"**
4. Click **"Create API Key"**
5. Copy the new key
6. Update in Vercel:
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/manabunagaokas-projects/manaboodle/settings/environment-variables
   - Find `RESEND_API_KEY`
   - Click Edit ‚Üí Paste new key ‚Üí Save
   - (Note: We're not using this currently, but keep it for future)
7. Redeploy: https://vercel.com/manabunagaokas-projects/manaboodle

### C. Rotate Database Password

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/otxidzozhdnszvqbgzne/settings/database
2. Click **"Reset Database Password"**
3. Copy the new password
4. Update `DATABASE_URL` in Vercel:
   - Format: `postgresql://postgres.otxidzozhdnszvqbgzne:[NEW_PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres`
   - Replace `[NEW_PASSWORD]` with the new password
   - Update both `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL` if present
5. Redeploy: https://vercel.com/manabunagaokas-projects/manaboodle

### D. Check Supabase Anon Key (Low Priority)

The anon key is less sensitive (it's meant to be public), but if you want to be thorough:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/otxidzozhdnszvqbgzne/settings/api
2. Under "Anon Public Key"
3. If there's a rotate option, use it
4. Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in Vercel
5. Redeploy

---

## üü° STEP 2: Verify Vercel Deployment

After rotating ALL secrets above:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/manabunagaokas-projects/manaboodle/deployments
2. Wait for deployment to complete (2-3 minutes)
3. Check deployment logs for any connection errors
4. If errors, verify all environment variables are set correctly

---

## üü¢ STEP 3: Close GitHub Alerts

After rotating all secrets:

1. Check your email or GitHub notifications
2. Find the Secret Scanning alerts
3. Click "Resolve" or "Mark as Fixed"
4. Confirm you've rotated the secrets
5. GitHub may ask for evidence - explain that secrets were rotated in Supabase/Resend dashboards

## üìã Exposed Secrets List (All Need Rotation)

| Secret Type | Location Exposed | Status | Action |
|-------------|------------------|--------|--------|
| Supabase Service Role Key | Git history | ‚ö†Ô∏è EXPOSED | ROTATE NOW |
| Resend API Key | Git history | ‚ö†Ô∏è EXPOSED | ROTATE NOW |
| Database Password | Git history | ‚ö†Ô∏è EXPOSED | ROTATE NOW |
| Supabase Anon Key | Git history | ‚ö†Ô∏è EXPOSED | ROTATE (optional) |

## üîç Files That Contained Secrets (Now Deleted)

These files were in Git history with full secret values:
- ‚ùå `SUPABASE_AUTH_DEPLOYMENT.md`
- ‚ùå `CURRENT_STATE.md`
- ‚ùå `SECURITY_INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md`
- ‚ùå `SECURITY_ALERT_COMPLETE.md`
- ‚ùå `CURRENT_STATUS_SUMMARY.md`
- ‚ùå `HARVARD_AUTH_ENHANCED_SECURITY.md`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `AUTHENTICATION_MIGRATION_REPORT.md` (updated with placeholders)

**Note**: Deleting files doesn't remove them from Git history. Anyone can still see them using:
```bash
git log --all --full-history -- CURRENT_STATE.md
git show <commit_hash>:CURRENT_STATE.md
```

This is why rotation is MANDATORY.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Why This Happened

1. Created documentation files during debugging
2. Included actual secret values for reference
3. Committed files to Git
4. Git keeps full history forever
5. GitHub Secret Scanning detected exposed secrets
6. Anyone with read access can view the secrets in Git history

---

## üö® Future Prevention

### DO:
- ‚úÖ Use placeholder values in documentation: `<your_secret_here>`
- ‚úÖ Reference where to find secrets: "See Vercel Dashboard"
- ‚úÖ Keep secrets ONLY in `.env.local` (gitignored)
- ‚úÖ Use environment variable references: `$SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

### DON'T:
- ‚ùå NEVER commit actual secret values
- ‚ùå NEVER put secrets in README files
- ‚ùå NEVER include secrets in code comments
- ‚ùå NEVER paste secrets in documentation

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Estimate

- Rotating all secrets: **10-15 minutes**
- Vercel redeployment: **2-3 minutes**
- Closing GitHub alerts: **5 minutes**
- **Total**: ~20 minutes

---

**PRIORITY**: Do this BEFORE tomorrow's debugging session. Once secrets are rotated, the authentication debugging can proceed safely.

**Status**: üî¥ **URGENT - Secrets exposed in public Git history**  
**Action**: Rotate all secrets listed above IMMEDIATELY  
**Timeline**: Complete within next hour if possible
