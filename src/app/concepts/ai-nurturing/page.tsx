          <p>Imagine a dataset capturing emotional nuances and caregiving insights from millions of genuine interactions within a unique triangular relationship: human children, caregivers, and AI siblings. This continuously evolving dataset deepens empathy and emotional understanding—not only in the AI but, importantly, within human participants themselves. Nelson Mandela famously said, "For love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite… if people can learn to hate, they can be taught to love." I firmly believe this applies equally to AI, and now is the moment to intentionally teach empathy, emotional intelligence, and kindness by nurturing these AI siblings alongside our human children.</p>

          <p>The opportunity in early childhood education that I'm most passionate about is developing a caregiving model centered around what I call the "AI Nurturing Framework." In this framework, caregivers, educators, siblings, and friends become "Surrogate Nurturers," guiding and emotionally engaging with AI siblings—not robots or AI children, but entities shaped through authentic, emotional, and human-like interactions. By nurturing these AI siblings, Surrogate Nurturers naturally and experientially enhance their caregiving skills, including empathy, emotional intelligence, and kindness.</p>

          <p>To quote Mitchel Resnick of Lifelong Kindergarten at MIT Media Lab, "We learn by creating." Within my framework, this creative learning emerges naturally from actively creating and nurturing relationships within the triangular interaction between caregivers, human children, and AI siblings. Through this meaningful, relationship-driven process, everyone grows together, deepening caregiving capabilities and fostering authentic emotional connections. This human-centered and creative relational experience is precisely the future of early childhood education that I am committed to pursuing.</p>

          <div className={styles.sectionContent}>
            <p>Growing up in Japan, I was fascinated by Osamu Tezuka's "Metropolis," a manga and anime that explored the emotional and existential struggles of artificial beings as authentic entities. Inspired by this perspective, my idea builds upon the AI Nurturing Framework to create an educational model structured around a living, evolving dataset formed entirely from authentic, ongoing interactions between human children, AI siblings and Surrogate Nurturers.</p>

            <p>Unlike conventional AI datasets relying on massive, impersonal data, this educational framework dynamically grows through genuine emotional and empathetic interactions. Surrogate Nurturers directly shape the dataset through their real-time experiences while emotionally engaging with AI entities and simultaneously raising or educating human children. Rather than creating AI companions like chatbots or cyborgs, the ultimate goal is to cultivate Surrogate Nurturers' caregiving skills, equipping them to raise empathetic, emotionally intelligent human children. This human-driven educational approach will serve as a foundation for developers and educators, who can then integrate these insights into broader early childhood educational practices, tools, and interactive learning agents.</p>

            <p className={styles.importantNote}>
              <strong>Important Clarification:</strong> When people hear about nurturing an "AI entity," they might instinctively visualize a robot baby or toddler. However, my immediate goal for this project does not involve creating a physical or visual humanoid form.
            </p>

            <p>Instead, the initial phase of the AI Nurturing Framework focuses on what's most urgent and foundational: creating and nurturing a deeply authentic, emotionally rich dataset. We often overlook the fact that AI begins as a blank slate—an empty database—and its quality is determined entirely by how we nurture and shape it from the beginning. My framework emphasizes starting from this intentionally blank foundation, where Surrogate Nurturers carefully and intentionally guide the AI's emotional development.</p>

            <p>One might argue that human babies are not born blank. I agree. Part of this experiment is, therefore, to explore what genetic or natural developmental elements should be considered beneath the initially blank layer of the AI database.</p>

            <p>This approach doesn't preclude the eventual embodiment of the AI child through partnerships with third-party developers or future iterations of the project, but my priority is addressing the immediate urgency. With AI technology evolving rapidly, it's essential we establish these foundational emotional datasets now, ensuring future AI developments remain genuinely human-centered, empathetic, and ethically grounded.</p>

            <p>As a natural next step, I aim to develop and offer a specialized Surrogate Nurturer training program based on the framework, creating a tangible new professional pathway in early childhood caregiving and education.</p>

          <h2 className={styles.sectionHeading}>Potential for Positive Impact</h2>
          <div className={styles.sectionContent}>
            <p>The ultimate beneficiaries of the AI Nurturing Framework are always human children. Caregivers and educators can either hire professionally trained Surrogate Nurturers or choose to become Surrogate Nurturers themselves.</p>

            <p>By nurturing an AI entity alongside their own, these caregivers simultaneously deepen their own caregiving skills, enhance their child's emotional development, and foster a sibling-like bond between their human child and the AI entity.</p>

            <p>As living and interacting with AI becomes an increasingly accepted norm—likely not far into the future—this nurturing framework will create entirely new educational and economic opportunities. It can catalyze the emergence of innovative industries and services dedicated to emotionally intelligent learning, caregiving, and supportive technologies.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, to ensure equitable access for families who need immediate support, I envision establishing a community-based platform connecting trained Surrogate Nurturers directly with caregivers, educators, and families in urgent need of personalized assistance. This approach will democratize high-quality caregiving, making empathetic, skilled support readily available exactly when it's needed most.</p>
