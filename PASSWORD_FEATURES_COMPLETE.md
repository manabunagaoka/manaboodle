# ✅ Password Features - Implementation Complete

## Summary

Both requested features have been successfully implemented:

1. ✅ **Email Integration for Password Reset** - Using Resend
2. ✅ **Password Visibility Toggle** - Eye icon on all password fields

---

## 1. 📧 Email Integration for Password Reset

### What Was Done
- Integrated **Resend** email service (already configured in your project)
- Password reset emails now send automatically when users request password reset
- Beautiful HTML email template with Harvard branding

### Email Features
- **From:** Harvard Portal <noreply@manaboodle.com>
- **Subject:** Reset Your Harvard Portal Password
- **Design:** Professional HTML template with Harvard colors (#A51C30)
- **Content:**
  - Clear call-to-action button
  - Backup text link (in case button doesn't work)
  - 1-hour expiration warning
  - Security notice if user didn't request reset

### How to Test
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/academic-portal/login`
2. Click "Forgot your password?"
3. Enter a registered `.edu` email
4. **Check your email inbox** - you should receive the reset email
5. Click the "Reset Password" button in the email
6. Set your new password

### Technical Implementation
- File: `/api/forgot-password/route.ts`
- Uses existing `RESEND_API_KEY` from environment variables
- Falls back gracefully if email fails (logs error but doesn't expose to user)
- Maintains security best practice (always returns success)

## 2. 👁️ Password Visibility Toggle

### What Was Done
Added eye icon buttons to all password fields that allow users to toggle between hidden and visible password text.

### Features
- **Eye icon** - Shows when password is hidden
- **Eye with slash icon** - Shows when password is visible
- **Click to toggle** - One click switches between hidden/visible
- **Accessible** - Includes aria-labels for screen readers
- **Positioned correctly** - Icon appears inside the password field on the right side

### Where It's Implemented
✅ **Signup Page** - Both "Password" and "Confirm Password" fields  
✅ **Login Page** - "Password" field  
✅ **Reset Password Page** - Both "New Password" and "Confirm New Password" fields

### How to Test
1. **Signup Page:** `http://localhost:3000/academic-portal/signup`
   - Enter a password
   - Click the eye icon → password becomes visible
   - Click again → password is hidden

2. **Login Page:** `http://localhost:3000/academic-portal/login`
   - Enter your password
   - Click the eye icon to toggle visibility

3. **Reset Password Page:** (after clicking reset link from email)
   - Enter new password
   - Use eye icons to verify you typed correctly

### Icons Used
- **Hidden (closed eye):** Standard eye icon
- **Visible (slashed eye):** Eye with slash through it
- **SVG format:** Crisp at any size, no external dependencies

## 📁 Files Modified

### Email Integration
- `src/app/api/forgot-password/route.ts` - Added Resend integration

## 🎨 User Experience Improvements

### Before
- ❌ Password reset links only appeared in console
- ❌ No way to verify typed password
- ❌ Users had to retype if they made a typo

### After
- ✅ Professional email with reset link
- ✅ Easy password verification with eye icon
- ✅ Reduces password typos during signup
- ✅ Better user confidence in authentication flow

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Email Security
- Always returns success (doesn't reveal if email exists)
- Tokens expire after 1 hour
- One-time use tokens
- Graceful error handling (email failures don't expose system info)

### Password Visibility
- Toggle is client-side only (password is never sent until form submits)
- Doesn't compromise security (user's choice to show password)
- Common UX pattern used by major sites (Google, Microsoft, etc.)
