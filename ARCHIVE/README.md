# Archive

This folder contains old/unused code that has been archived for reference.

## Contents

### `old-clusters/`
- **Original location:** `/src/app/clusters`
- **Status:** Archived (superseded by new version from external repo)
- **Note:** This was an early prototype. The latest Clusters implementation was developed in a separate repository and is now integrated into `/src/app/academic-portal/clusters`

### `test-files/`
- **Contents:** Test scripts and development files
  - `test-cluster.js` - Clustering algorithm test
  - `test-sendgrid.js` - Email service test
  - `test-cluster/` folder - Test UI for clusters
- **Status:** Archived (no longer needed)

## Why Archive?

These files were moved here during the migration to Academic Portal (October 2025) to:
1. Keep the codebase clean
2. Preserve old code for reference
3. Prevent confusion between old and new implementations

## Can These Be Deleted?

After confirming the new Academic Portal versions work in production, these archived files can be safely deleted.
