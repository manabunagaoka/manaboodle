# NUCLEAR DEPLOYMENT TRIGGER

**CRITICAL: Harvard Demo Ready - Deployment Pipeline Broken**

## Status: READY FOR HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL DEMO
- ✅ Harvard Business School consultant prompts working perfectly locally
- ✅ Sophisticated business analysis operational  
- ✅ Deterministic clustering for consistent demo results
- ✅ Professional demo interface at /test-cluster
- ✅ All environment variables configured in Vercel dashboard

## DEPLOYMENT CRISIS
